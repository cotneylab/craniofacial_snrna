# Code related to processing and analyzing snRNA-seq data from human and mouse craniofacial development.
<img src="overview.jpg" alt="Graphical Abstract">

Scripts for clustering, removal of neuronal cell types, and annotation of cell types in both human and mouse are found in the clustering directory.

Scripts for generation of major panels in main figure 7-8 are found in magma_celltyping directory.

Script for generating interactive website is found in shinycell directory.

Cellranger data files and Seurat objects for human and mouse can be found on zenodo: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14343226

These data can also be explored in an interactive format based on ShinyCell2 here: https://cotneyshiny.research.chop.edu/shiny-apps/craniofacial_all_snRNA_v2/


Original version of scripts now in old directory. Original shinyapp based on ShinyCell here: https://cotneyshiny.research.chop.edu/shiny-apps/craniofacial_all_snRNA/
